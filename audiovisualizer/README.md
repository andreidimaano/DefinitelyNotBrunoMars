Start changing things like this:

- Adjust size and length in `src/Video.tsx`
- Replacing audio, cover and subtitles in the `src/assets` folder
- Tweak `src/Composition.tsx`

## How do I render my video?

Run this:

```console
yarn build
```

Or check out the [Remotion docs](/docs/render/). There are lots of ways to render.

## Where to get a transcript (SRT file)?
