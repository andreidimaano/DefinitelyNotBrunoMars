Voice DeepFake and Pose Transfer using GANs UCR CS228 Deep Learning Final Project

MaskGAN-VC
1. install pip3 install on requirements.txt
2. Dataset:
    - Create a folder in root directory called "training-data"
    - Upload these [4 folders](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HuwZcXkjUETTXvENUrUyhUk0Z8KqlMR0?usp=sharing) into "training-data"
    - Create a folder in the root directory called "og-training-data"
    - Upload these [2 folders](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AfjN0yvVaywEGZV0_qO2ltKP-4lDpeZc?usp=sharing) into "og-training-data"
    - run the "create_norm_spec_submission.ipynb"
3. Training:
    - Run "train_submission.ipynb". The notebook will output loss, and MCDs. It will also output wavs into "/code/outputs/generated_audio


Dance GAN:
visualization file and dance code :
[drive files for visualization file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/125cfU69dP0IaqL6Xvl77wSKu4WtCz92j?usp=drive_link)

1. Run the notebook "run_Dance.ipynb"
    - Dataset: Need to have "DL Project"(linked above) in personal drive.
    - **Important**: you must stop the notebook where it tell you to stop (the notebook will instruct you). Then follow the instruction in the notebook
